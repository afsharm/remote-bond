# Remote Bond
**Companies who are willing to offer remote IT jobs**

If you want to add any company in this list, please notice a few simple rules:
* It is an alphabet sorted list
* Make a distinguish between companies who has employed experts remotely and companies who claim they are OK with remote exmployees but not a proven employment yet.
* Employment must be witnessed bu yourself or a close contact. Not just by the claim of the companies, unknown people or lists over the internet.
* To make the list accurate, please do not forget to mention exact date of each claim or employment. Some companies have had employed remote worker in past but have stopped the remote policy after then.
* This list should only show the companies who are currently on remote policies, say if they have any employment, they are OK with a remote candidate. If they have stopped the policy, then they should be removed from the list.
